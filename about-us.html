																		<p class="x_MsoNormal">Borrowed Time is a non-for- profit 501C3 Equine facility that
																			is operating in Benton County, Indiana.&nbsp; Benton County is in the northwest
																			part of the state of Indiana, along the border with Illinois. It is a small tight
																			knit rural farm community with generations of famers that have maintained the
																			county and helped it to prosper.&nbsp;The population of Benton County in 2018 was
																			8,653 and 2018 was the first year that had an increase in growth since 1960. The
																			community is proud of its heritage and continues to grow a little more each year.
																		</p>
																		<p class="x_MsoNormal">The equine facility was built to provide equine assisted
																			therapy to the citizens of Benton County at no charge and is targeting the
																			adolescent population to provide and safe outlet and community center.</p>
																		<p class="x_MsoNormal">The idea is to work with the youth population to prevent the
																			use of drugs and alcohol and provide some guidance outside of their regular
																			environment and individual family norms. The facility provides an inclusive
																			therapeutic environment that allows for an opportunity to seek connections with
																			nature and animals.</p>
																		<p class="x_MsoNormal">The equine center is open to everyone in Benton County to
																			provide a community re-enforcement approach to the people of our community.&nbsp;
																			There are no outdoor community centers with a animal centered focus that provide a
																			place to get away from the daily issues we struggle with whether that is at home,
																			school or work.&nbsp; The equine facility will provide an outlet or refuge to
																			anymore that wants to enjoy the peaceful open spaces in the company of horses.
																			There is also an activity center attached to the arena that is open to anyone
																			interested in escaping the daily pressures. The facility will also be open to the
																			general public for private events, lesson and therapy and can be coordinated
																			through our contact page.</p>
																		<p class="x_MsoNormal">The facility and the equine therapy will provide a different
																			social environment that is much different than typical therapy or physical
																			activity.&nbsp; The pressure and anxiety associated with one on one therapy or
																			group therapy is relieved when the focus is placed on the reaction and the
																			behavior of the horse.&nbsp; Working with the horse helps the person to become
																			self-aware and in control of their emotions and actions in a natural unrehearsed
																			manner.&nbsp; Physical activity has long been know to release endorphins which are
																			neurotransmitters that help with depression and are out of balance in many
																			adolescents, addicts and trauma patients.&nbsp; The act of grooming, walking,
																			tacking and socializing with the animal can be physically strenuous and will
																			increase the heart and respiratory rate and is a very unique benefit of this
																			therapeutic environment.</p>

														<p class="x_MsoNormal">Why horses?</p>
														<p class="x_MsoNormal">A horse in motion is captivating, a horse out of control is
															terrifying and horse at peace brings peace to its environment.&nbsp; They are unique and
															beautiful creatures that bring a sense of awe and wonder to any setting.</p>
														<p class="x_MsoNormal">Horses are some of the largest domesticated animals and regardless of
															their gentle nature and eagerness to please, can be very intimidating to people.&nbsp;
															Regardless of their size, they are a prey animal and their reactions to situations are
															direct result of their natural instinct however their domestication has caused them to
															look to their human partner for direction and security. This relationship and the
															dependence on people enables a person to quickly develop confidence, self-awareness,
															self-control and build trust with the horse.</p>
														<p class="x_MsoNormal">The horses serve as a tool in the therapy on many different levels,
															depending on the type of therapy.&nbsp; The horse serves as a distraction so that the
															person concentrates more the activity and the consequence of their actions. Concentrating
															on the horse, relieves the person internal pressures and inhibitions and allows the person
															to be himself /herself.&nbsp; Horses are a direct reflection of their environment and the
															person will be able to observe how their emotions and their actions affect the horse and
															their surroundings.&nbsp; People watching the activities will also gain insight and
															therapeutic benefit just by observing and learning.</p>
														<p class="x_MsoNormal">If you have any interest in horses we can design an activity for
															you.&nbsp; Please don’t hesitate to contact us with any requests or ideas.</p>

																		<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Kelly Adams grew up in the saddle. Kelly started
																			riding before she could walk, and her love for the horse was instilled at a very
																			young age. She began her riding endeavors on various breeds of horses. Kelly is a
																			well-rounded rider capable of dealing with many breeds and many disciplines.</p>
																		<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Kelly also began her show career in 4-H. She later
																			went on to showing in open shows and did exceptionally well. During this time,
																			Kelly found her true passion was to be a riding coach and share her experience as
																			a rider and showman.</p>
																		<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">She believes building a solid foundation in a rider
																			is of key importance. By instilling knowledge and confidence in her students, she
																			is able to get them to unlock their full potential. Kelly matches each client with
																			an appropriate horse so they can gain confidence and feel relaxed while learning.
																			A proper equine match is essential when building a foundation on correct
																			equestrian skills. Kelly inspires her clients to be the best they can be. As a
																			mother to three adopted boys through the Indiana foster care system she first hand
																			knows the important of therapy services to help children deal with trauma. Kelly
																			is working towards her PATH certification as a certified equine specialist and is
																			an all around equestrian. Kelly has had life experiences with the adoption system
																			and is an avid supporter of therapies directed to help children and adolescents
																			cope with transition process.</p>

																		<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Darcy Lash has always owned a horse or a pony. As a
																			young person she never had any formal training with horses. She has never shown or
																			participated in 4H but has always been in the company of horses and has always
																			considered them to be an integral part of her daily life.<br>
																			She graduated from high school and worked as a groom for 5 years at a horse race
																			track in the Chicago-land area. She eventually found her way to college to obtain
																			a masters degree in industrial chemistry and worked in the industrial field for 12
																			years.<br>
																			During her time as a chemist, she rescued 13 horses in need of acute medical care
																			and months of good nutrition. She boarded the horses at a nearby barn until she
																			was able to lease a facility. From there a successful boarding barn was
																			established and all of the horses were returned to good health and adopted out to
																			permanent homes.</p>
																		<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">While running a successful boarding barn, Darcy had
																			the opportunity to go to medical school and she sold the business and went on to
																			achieve her medical degree. During her pursuit of her MD she was also able to
																			achieve a masters in clinical trial administration.<br>
																			She graduated medical school in 2015 and completed her residency in Terre Haute
																			Indiana and is currently a hospitalist with IU Health. During her residency she
																			noticed a disturbing trend with the youth population in underserved areas. She
																			noted that drug use was very prevalent in both rural and urban communities and
																			there were very limited resources dealing with education and prevention of drug
																			abuse in the adolescent population.</p>
