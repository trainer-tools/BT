        Borrowed Time is a <strong>non-for-profit</strong> 501C3 Equine facility that is operating in Benton County, Indiana. Benton County is
        in the northwest part of the state of Indiana, along the border with Illinois. It is a small tight knit rural farm
        community with generations of famers that have maintained the county and helped it to prosper. The population of Benton
        County in 2018 was 8,653 and 2018 was the first year that had an increase in growth since 1960. The community is proud
        of its heritage and continues to grow a little more each year.
        </p>

        <p>
        The equine facility was built to provide equine assisted therapy to the citizens of Benton County at no charge and is
        targeting the adolescent population to provide and safe outlet and community center.
        </p>

        <p>
        The idea is to work with the youth population to prevent the use of drugs and alcohol and provide some guidance outside
        of their regular environment and individual family norms. The facility provides an inclusive therapeutic environment
        that allows for an opportunity to seek connections with nature and animals.
        </p>

        <p>
        The equine center is open to everyone in Benton County to provide a community re-enforcement approach to the people of
        our community. There are no outdoor community centers with a animal centered focus that provide a place to get away from
        the daily issues we struggle with whether that is at home, school or work. The equine facility will provide an outlet or
        refuge to anymore that wants to enjoy the peaceful open spaces in the company of horses. There is also an activity
        center attached to the arena that is open to anyone interested in escaping the daily pressures. The facility will also
        be open to the general public for private events, lesson and therapy and can be coordinated through our contact page.
        </p>

        </p>
        The facility and the equine therapy will provide a different social environment that is much different than typical
        therapy or physical activity. The pressure and anxiety associated with one on one therapy or group therapy is relieved
        when the focus is placed on the reaction and the behavior of the horse. Working with the horse helps the person to
        become self-aware and in control of their emotions and actions in a natural unrehearsed manner. Physical activity has
        long been know to release endorphins which are neurotransmitters that help with depression and are out of balance in
        many adolescents, addicts and trauma patients. The act of grooming, walking, tacking and socializing with the animal can
        be physically strenuous and will increase the heart and respiratory rate and is a very unique benefit of this
        therapeutic environment.

<!-- WHY HORSES-->
<div class="container-fluid">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-8">
      <h3>Why horses?</h3>
  
      <p>
      A horse in motion is captivating, a horse out of control is terrifying and horse at peace brings peace to its
      environment. They are unique and beautiful creatures that bring a sense of awe and wonder to any setting.
      </p>

      </p>
      Horses are some of the largest domesticated animals and regardless of their gentle nature and eagerness to please, can
      be very intimidating to people. Regardless of their size, they are a prey animal and their reactions to situations are
      direct result of their natural instinct however their domestication has caused them to look to their human partner for
      direction and security. This relationship and the dependence on people enables a person to quickly develop confidence,
      self-awareness, self-control and build trust with the horse.
      </p>

      <p>
      The horses serve as a tool in the therapy on many different levels, depending on the type of therapy. The horse serves
      as a distraction so that the person concentrates more the activity and the consequence of their actions. Concentrating
      on the horse, relieves the person internal pressures and inhibitions and allows the person to be himself /herself.
      Horses are a direct reflection of their environment and the person will be able to observe how their emotions and their
      actions affect the horse and their surroundings. People watching the activities will also gain insight and therapeutic
      benefit just by observing and learning.
      </p>

      <p>
      If you have any interest in horses we can design an activity for you. Please don’t hesitate to contact us with any
      requests or ideas.

    <div class="col-lg-8">
      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1 text-uppercase">Darcy Lash - President</h5>
      <p>
        Darcy Lash has always owned a horse or a pony. As a young person she never had any formal training with horses. She
        has
        never shown or participated in 4H but has always been in the company of horses and has always considered them to be an
        integral part of her daily life.
      </p>
      <p>
        She graduated from high school and worked as a groom for 5 years at a horse race track in the Chicago-land area. She
        eventually found her way to college to obtain a masters degree in industrial chemistry and worked in the industrial
        field for 12 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        During her time as a chemist, she rescued 13 horses in need of acute medical care and months of good nutrition. She
        boarded the horses at a nearby barn until she was able to lease a facility. From there a successful boarding barn was
        established and all of the horses were returned to good health and adopted out to permanent homes.
      </p>
      <p>
        While running a successful boarding barn, Darcy had the opportunity to go to medical school and she sold the business
        and went on to achieve her medical degree. During her pursuit of her MD she was also able to achieve a masters in
        clinical trial administration.
      </p>
      <p>
        She graduated medical school in 2015 and completed her residency in Terre Haute Indiana and is currently a hospitalist
        with IU Health. During her residency she noticed a disturbing trend with the youth population in underserved areas.
        She
        noted that drug use was very prevalent in both rural and urban communities and there were very limited resources
        dealing
        with education and prevention of drug abuse in the adolescent population.
      </p>
      <p>
        Near the end of her residency one of her attending physicians handed her an article describing the benefits of equine
        therapy for recovering addicts, PTSD and autism. From this point forward, Darcy has been pursuing her dream of
        establishing a community equine facility that could provide equine therapies with the goal of improving the emotional
        well being of, at risk youth populations and victims suffering from anxiety, PTSD and addiction. Darcy is not only an
        experienced equestrian but also has the medical background to serve the community in which lives.
